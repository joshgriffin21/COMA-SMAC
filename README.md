# COMA-SMAC
## Explorting Value Function Factorisation in COMA 
*Final Year Computer Science Project* <br /> 
Uses codebase from https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl <br />
<br />
*Training Multi-Agent systems to perform in cooperative environments.* <br />
Extending COMA by implementing value function factorisation that reintroduces decentralised learning.
